# LoRa Tem, Humidity, Pressure - Sensor

made of a board from Belgium 
see:  https://eth0maz.wordpress.com/2016/05/27/lorawan-iot-node/
using that board you have to solder DIO1, DIO2 & Reset to pins of your choice

# BOM
- TbV Board (this version used here will not longer be sold)
- HTU21D Humidity & Temperature Sensor
- BMP180 Pressure and Temperature Sensor

in a next version these two sensors will be replaced by a BME280 which will give all data out of one
